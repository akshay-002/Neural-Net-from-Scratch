# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks from Scratch

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using neural networks implemented from scratch. It utilizes Python along with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib for data manipulation, neural network implementation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to develop a model capable of correctly identifying handwritten digits (0-9) from images.

### Data
The project uses the MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is preprocessed to prepare it for training. This includes converting the data into arrays, splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets, and converting labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
2. **Neural Network Implementation**: Neural networks are implemented from scratch, including forward and backward propagation algorithms for training.
3. **Training**: The neural network is trained on the training data using mini-batch gradient descent. The model's parameters are updated iteratively to minimize the cost function.
4. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy are calculated to measure the model's effectiveness.
5. **Prediction**: Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data (test set).

## Usage

To use the code provided in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with required libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib).
3. Run the provided Python scripts in a suitable environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) to train the neural network and make predictions.

## Results

The performance of the trained model can be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy on the validation and test sets. Additionally, visualization techniques can be employed to analyze the model's behavior and understand its predictions.

## Future Work

Possible future enhancements to the project include:

- Initialization Methods: Explore alternative weight initialization techniques beyond the default.
- Optimization Algorithms: Implement different optimization algorithms such as momentum, RMSprop, or Adam for training the neural network.
- Regularization Techniques: Incorporate regularization methods such as L1 or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
- Deploying the model for real-world applications, such as mobile digit recognition apps.

These additional functionalities allow for further experimentation and customization of the neural network model.

## Additional Functionality

In addition to the main script for training and prediction, this repository includes .py files containing development function definitions for the future work.
